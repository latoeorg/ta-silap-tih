## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns
- **Vuex State Management**: Centralized state with module pattern
- **Component Composition**: Reusable components with consistent props interface
- **Form Validation**: Integrated validation using existing validator utilities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notifications

### Data Flow
1. **API Communication**: Uses existing axiosInstance for consistent API calls
2. **State Updates**: Reactive state updates through Vuex mutations
3. **UI Reactivity**: Computed properties for real-time data updates
4. **Event Handling**: Proper event emission for component communication

### Code Quality
- **ESLint Compliance**: All lint errors resolved
- **Consistent Formatting**: Follows project code style guidelines
- **Proper Imports**: Organized import statements
- **Component Structure**: Consistent component organization

## API Integration

### Expected API Endpoints
- `GET /attendance` - List attendance records
- `POST /attendance` - Create attendance record
- `PUT /attendance/:id` - Update attendance record  
- `DELETE /attendance/:id` - Delete attendance record

- `GET /grades` - List grade records
- `POST /grades` - Create grade record
- `PUT /grades/:id` - Update grade record
- `DELETE /grades/:id` - Delete grade record

- `GET /assessment-weight` - List assessment weights
- `POST /assessment-weight` - Create assessment weight
- `PUT /assessment-weight/:id` - Update assessment weight
- `DELETE /assessment-weight/:id` - Delete assessment weight

### Course API Response Structure
The system works with the provided course API response structure:
```json
{
  "id": "course_id",
  "name": "Course Name", 
  "subjectId": "subject_id",
  "teacherId": "teacher_id",
  "classGroupId": "class_group_id",
  "teacher": { "id": "", "name": "", "email": "", "role": "" },
  "subject": { "id": "", "name": "", "createdAt": "", "updatedAt": "" }
}
```

## User Experience Features

### Intuitive Interface
- **Clear Navigation**: Easy-to-understand tab structure
- **Consistent Design**: Follows Vuetify Material Design principles
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all screen sizes

### Efficient Workflows
- **Bulk Operations**: Batch entry for attendance and grades
- **Quick Actions**: One-click edit and delete operations
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate validation and status updates

### Data Visualization
- **Statistics Cards**: Key metrics at a glance
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars for attendance rates
- **Activity Timeline**: Recent activity tracking
- **Color Coding**: Status-based color indicators

## Maintenance & Extensibility

### Code Organization
- **Modular Components**: Easy to extend and maintain
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows established project conventions
- **Reusable Utilities**: Shared utility functions

### Future Extensions
- **Additional Exam Types**: Easy to add new exam types
